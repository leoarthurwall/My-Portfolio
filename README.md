## :motorway: PROCESS 
- Plan
    - Miro
        - step-1 set up a miro board to use as a collaborative platform for planing. 
   - user stories/ personas
        - To ensure to meet the needs of the user, firstly clarified who our target audience is. With the primary purpose being employemnt, recruiters, hiring managers and developers/designers would be our main audience. therefore, the design & development decisions were tailored to meet their (your) needs.
   - competitor analysis
        - With the target audience clear. and reviewed a number of portfolios. This was beneficial for a number of reasons, including: design, layout & content inspiration as well as an insight into potentially good practices. All of which helped to inspire our very own portfolio.
    - Component/ function tree
        - Next, it was good idea to use the previously gained inspiration to agree on what sections, functionality & componenta that would include. 
        
## :art: DESIGN
- Design
    - Lo-fi Prototype
        - We developed a lo-fi prototype using miro to get an idea of how our single-page portfolio will be laidout. all of the previously agreed sections, functions and components were now put into their respective layout.
    Hi-fi prototype
        - Once the lo-fi prototype was agreed, we developed a hi-fi protoyype using figma. Drawing on inspiration from our competitor analysis, we decided on our colour pallette & typography and designed a working prototype on figma which we were both happy to move into development.
